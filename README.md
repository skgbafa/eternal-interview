# Eternal Demo Server

## Overview
This is a server setup to showcase my ability and considerations when working on a beackend server! It's pretty minimal, but should do the following:

- Registration
- Authentication
- Fetch/Update User Account Data
- Add/remove followers to a user

I plan to implement this using typescript and graphql, with a mongo backend. Will probs host this on heroku for demo purposes. 

This is just a plan, for now...


## Deployment
This app is deloyed on heroku at https://eternal-interveiw.herokuapp.com/
